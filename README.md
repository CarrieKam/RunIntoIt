# RunIntoIt
TechNova 2021

This project was inpired by a conversation that I had. I always wanted to create an app that I trust so I can write my journal. Also, it has to meet all my criterias. Even though this project is not done. I feel it's pretty good for the time that I had and consequences that I faced... like accidentally cleaned every file of my desktop... yea... Eclipse and gitHub didn't want to work together....
